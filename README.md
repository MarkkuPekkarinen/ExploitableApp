## What is the Exploitable App?

Exploitable App is a sandbox for exploring the various ways that applications can be exploited by attackers. Designed to emulate a banking application with various vulnerabilities the Exploitable App is a learning platform that attempts to teach about common web security flaws. The Exploitable App contains generic security flaws that apply to most web applications and it also contains vulnerabilities that specifically pertain to the .NET framework. The vulnerabilities in this app are intented to teach about application security and the code is commented in a way that will allow developers to follow along and learn how to avoid the most common vulnerabilities.

## Run in Azure [From Linux, Mac, Windows via WSL/WSL2]

```
git clone https://github.com/postworthy/ExploitableApp.git
cd ExploitableApp/HelmCHarts
.\aks-install.sh
```

## Dive into the Code

Because the application is built using .NET Core you will want to start by getting the latest version of <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a> which is currently available for Windows and Mac. You will then need to install <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker</a> for your system. Last but not least you will want to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> for pulling the latest code from the repo.

After you have navigated to your working folder you will want to get the latest code for the project using git

##### Windows & Mac

```
git clone https://github.com/postworthy/ExploitableApp.git
```

Once you have cloned the repo open the `ExploitableApp.sln` file to start exploring the code.
